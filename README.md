# Comcast Usage

I came across this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/3puhp2/do_you_have_comcastxfinity_use_my_script_to_check/) on reddit. The script seems like a good idea, so I forked it and made a tweak or two.

## Setup

	git clone https://github.com/escobarj/comcastUsage.git
	cd comcastUsage
	pip install -r requirements.txt
